A main class named myNumberList which has the following functions:
- a constructor: has an optional argument that will be added to the list
- add(value): will insert it at the end of the list
- remove(value): will remove the item from the list (if item is there multiple times, it removes all occurrences).
- head(): returns the value in the beginning of the list
- getList(): will return the list
- if I call print(myNumberList) the list would be printed

 

A subclass named myRevOrderedNumberList (from high to low) which  overwrites
- head() function and returns the highest value and
- overwrites the print functionality to be printed appropriately
- getList(): will return the list
