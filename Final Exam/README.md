# CSCI-6651

Final exam. University of New Haven CSCI 6651 course


Question 1

A program which can filter even numbers in a list by using filter and lambda function. The list is: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].

Question 2

Define a custom exception class which takes a string message as attribute

Question 3

With a given tuple (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10), write a program to print the first half values in one line and the last half values in one line.

Question 4

Define a function which can generate a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 20 (both included) and the values are square of keys. The function should just print the keys only.

Question 5

Define a class named Circle which can be constructed by a radius. The Circle class has a method which can compute the area.

Question 6

Write a program that accepts a sequence of lines as input and prints the lines after making all characters in the sentence capitalized.

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

Hello world

Practice makes perfect

Then, the output should be:

HELLO WORLD

PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT


Question 7

Write a program that takes 2 digits, X, Y as input, and generates a 2-dimensional array. The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j.

Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,¡­Y-1.

Example

Suppose the following inputs are given to the program:

3,5

Then, the output of the program should be:

[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]]

Question 8

Write a program that computes the net amount of a bank account based a transaction log from console input. The transaction log format is shown as following:

D 100

W 200

D means deposit while W means withdrawal.

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

D 300

D 300

W 200

D 100

Then, the output should be:

500


Question 9

Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of letters and digits.

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

hello world! 123

Then, the output should be:

LETTERS 10

DIGITS 3


Question 10

Write a program to compute the frequency of the words from the input. The output should output after sorting the key alphanumerically.

Question 11

A website requires the users to input a username and a password to register. Write a program to check the validity of password input by users.

Following are the criteria for checking the password:

At least 1 letter between [a-z]

At least 1 number between [0-9]

At least 1 letter between [A-Z]

At least 1 character from [$#@]

Minimum length of transaction password: 6

Maximum length of transaction password: 12

Your program should accept a sequence of comma-separated passwords and will check them according to the above criteria. Passwords that match the criteria are to be printed, each separated by a comma.
